# **Intrusion Detection**
The purpose of this project is to train machine learning models that can classify streams and be able to recognize different attacks, i.e., models used for multi-class classification tasks.<br>
The NSL-KDD dataset (KDDTrainClean.csv) represents a benchmark for Intrusion Detection systems. The dataset contains information about network traffic flows to an IT infrastructure. Each flow is labeled as “normal” or associated with an attack type. The label column of the dataset represents the label.
